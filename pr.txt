Upload all your laravel files (as it is) from localhost to /htdocs - it is better to create a subfolder under /htdocs to better manage the project.
Export phpMyAdmin DB and import to infinity DB. Should obtain all the credentials needed to set the DB credentials in .env file.
Update the DB settings in .env file.
Create a .htaccess file at /htdocs folder. see e.g. file
< IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule (.*) /your_subfolder/public/$1 [L]
< /IfModule>
The shared host server therefore is quite friendly to Laravel deployment and this is a top-class server configuration, different from other hosting providers.
Due to lack of SSH, one may face laravel specific error but this is not a big issue if one is familiar with Laravel.
